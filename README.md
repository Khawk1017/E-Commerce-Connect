# E-Commerce-Connect

## Description 
**This is an ecommerce application that uses an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with a database. It is designed to be used in Insomnia, a popular REST API client, to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on ecommerce entities such as products, orders, and customers.**

### Usage
To use this app, you'll need to have Insomnia installed on your machine. Once you have Insomnia installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using npm install.
3. Create a .env file in the root of the project and add your database credentials. Here's an example:

``` 
DB_NAME=mydb
DB_USER=myuser
DB_PASSWORD=mypassword

```
4. Start the app using npm start.
5. Open Insomnia and import the Insomnia_ORM_Ecommerce_App.json file located in the insomnia directory of this project.
6. Start sending requests to the app using Insomnia. You can perform CRUD operations on products, orders, and customers using the endpoints provided in the imported Insomnia collection.

 
### Purpose 
The purpose of this app is to provide a simple, yet powerful ecommerce solution that can be easily integrated with any frontend or backend application. The app uses an ORM to abstract away the complexity of interacting with a database, making it easy for developers to focus on building their ecommerce features without worrying about the underlying database operations.

By using Insomnia to interact with the app, developers can easily test their ecommerce features and debug any issues that arise. The app provides a clear and concise set of REST API endpoints that can be used to perform CRUD operations on ecommerce entities, making it easy to integrate with any frontend or backend application.
